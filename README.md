# Flight-History-Analysis-Using-PySpark

The aim of the project is to collect data and study flight delay history.The amount of available is enormous, and it is growing every day. This project makes use of big data concepts such as Apache Spark, pyspark , SparkSQL, SparkMLlib which makes data analytics faster to process data and derive valuable information from it. This will aid in identifying the causes of delays in the aviation sector, allowing necessary decisions to be made, as well as helping consumers and aviation industrialists. The main objective is to clean, process, visualize and predict flight delay at a particular airport using Pyspark. Spark SQL and DataFrames has been used to explore real historic airline data. Machine Learning uses data and statistics, as a result can give finer grained predictions.Thus, To make prediction of the flight delay MLLib library has been used. The following characteristics were taken into account when creating the predictive model: timeslot, Uniquecarrier, Distance between Origin and destination and Month.

## Google Colab Environment Setup
This project is built using following dependencies : 
- Python 3.8, Pyspark 3.1.1, MLlib,Pandas, Numpy, SQLContext and iPython-Jupyter Notebook.
